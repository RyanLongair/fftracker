			<br>

			Towns/Shops have a new detailed tracker! Clicking on a Town will bring up a menu of popular items that are in the game and allow the user to select one or many items that are found at that location<br>
			Using the "Disable Item Tracking" feature on the launcher will hide the Towns/Shops selection<br>
			When the S5 flag is active, the Towns/Shops section will also be disabled, as nobody needs to track a billion Cabins<br>
			The Trapped Chests section will show up when K3+ flags are active<br>
			Text will be smaller to handle size constraints when the Trapped Chests section is active (Having the Towns/Shops section disabled will counter this change and have the text remain the normal size)<br>
